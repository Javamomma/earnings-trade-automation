# Earnings Trade Automation

Automated trading bot for executing earnings calendar spread strategies using options in a workflow automation. Integrates with Google Sheets for trade tracking and Alpaca for order execution. 

## Features
- **Automated Earnings Calendar Spread Trading**: Opens and closes calendar spreads around earnings events based on strict screening criteria.
- **Kelly Criterion Position Sizing**: Uses a 10% Kelly fraction for optimal, risk-managed position sizing.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Tracks trades and workflow status in a Google Sheet via Apps Script.
- **Alpaca API Integration**: Places and closes trades automatically using Alpaca brokerage API.
- **Configurable and Extensible**: Modular codebase for easy strategy tweaks and integration.

## Strategy Overview
We implement an earnings volatility selling strategy focusing on calendar spreads around earnings events:

- Rationale: Implied volatility spikes ahead of earnings due to hedgers and speculators, creating an opportunity to profit from IV crush and muted stock moves.
- Trade Structure: At-the-money calendar spreads with a 30-day expiration gap for stability, offering controlled risk compared to straddles.
- Screening Criteria: Filter for high-probability trades using:
  - **Term Structure Slope**: Negative slope between front-month and 45-day expirations (backwardation).
  - **30-Day Average Volume**: Ensures sufficient liquidity and price-insensitive demand.
  - **IV/RV Ratio**: High implied-to-realized volatility ratio indicates overpriced options.
- Position Sizing: Apply a 10% Kelly fraction for optimal, risk-managed sizing.

## Example Workflow
- **Screen for Earnings**: Bot fetches tomorrow's earnings tickers.
- **Screening & Sizing**: For each ticker, applies IV/volume/slope criteria and calculates position size using Kelly.
- **Open Trades**: Places calendar spread trades at the correct time (BMO/AMC logic).
- **Track & Close**: Monitors open trades and closes them at the correct time, updating Google Sheets.
